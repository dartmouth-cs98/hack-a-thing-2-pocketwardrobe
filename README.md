## What We Built

This is an iOS app built with Swift using the tutorial on the official Apple Developer Website: https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/

We wanted to give ourselves a tougher challenge than just following the tutorial, so we decided to make an app that allows the user to document and track all their clothes on their phone by creating new tableview cells.  

## Who did What

We worked side by side for most of the project so that we could help each other when confused, since this was a new technology for both of us.  Jane started the basic skeleton of the app by setting up the UI of creating a new item with an image and connecting those parts to the ViewController.  Daniel then worked on TableViewCells and the TableViewController, as well as the Data Model.  Jane then finished connecting navigation segue flow and the funcionality of 'save' and 'cancel'.  

## What We learned


## Relation to CS98

We both wanted to learn iOS because we both know React and Jane has been working with React-Native for a few years now.  iOS Swift was uncharted territory for both of us and we wanted exposure to the different types of mobile development to explore the pain points and the benefits of several tech stacks.  We both see mobile development as a huge

## Difficulties / What Didn't Work

* We ran into several problems, the first being the fact that the tutorial was slightly outdated and it didn't completely align with the current Xcode version.  We had to do some troubleshooting and debugging on our own to solve these issues.  

* Additionally, we decided to pursue our own app's purpose of being for clothes rather than a food tracker, which is what the tutorial teaches.  We ran into some bugs because we would get confused with substituting variable and class names so we had to be careful with reading the actual code of the tutorial and understanding it rather than just copy-pasting.
