## What We Built

This is an iOS app built with Swift using the tutorial on the official Apple Developer Website: https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/

We wanted to give ourselves a tougher challenge than just following the tutorial, so we decided to make an app that allows the user to document and track all their clothes on their phone by creating new items so they could view it on a list and pick their outfits by scrolling their phone rather than their physical closet.  We saw the need that many people don't actually see all the items in their wardrobe and just gravitate towards their favorite items, but this app would open the user to being more experimental and original with their outfit pairings.  

Users are able to create a new item by taking a photo of their article of clothing or uploading a photo and then naming it.  It would then appear in a list.

## Who did What

We worked side by side for most of the project so that we could help each other when confused, since this was a new technology for both of us.  Jane started the basic skeleton of the app by setting up the UI of creating a new item with an image and connecting those parts to the ViewController.  Daniel then worked on TableViewCells and the TableViewController, as well as the Data Model.  Jane then finished connecting navigation segue flow and the funcionality of 'save' and 'cancel'.  

## What We learned

We learned a lot through this Swift tutorial.  We come away from this project with an understanding of how the UI Layout works in Swift, using storyboards and connecting those parts to code using @IBAction.  We learned how XCode abstracts a lot of manual work by just clicking and dragging certain UI elements and how smart the program is with predicting what you're about to type.  


We understood the breakdown of .swift files, from ViewController files to TableViewCells to TableViewControllers.  We learned that with XCode challenges the user to really have to think about the layout of how their mobile app will look on the go.  Ultimately, we just learned how Swift as a technology works and the process of developing a simple mobile app.  


## Relation to CS98

We both wanted to learn iOS because we both know React and Jane has been working with React-Native for a few years now.  iOS Swift was uncharted territory for both of us and we wanted exposure to the different types of mobile development to explore the pain points and the benefits of parallel tech stacks.  We both see mobile development as a huge relevance to our CS98 projects because it can be a flexible means to an end for any project/pursuit.  We think that in most projects, web and mobile apps can still act as a platform even if its not the main product.

## Difficulties / What Didn't Work

* We ran into several problems, the first being the fact that the tutorial was slightly outdated and it didn't completely align with the current Xcode version.  We had to do some troubleshooting and debugging on our own to solve these issues.  

* Additionally, we decided to pursue our own app's purpose of being for clothes rather than a food tracker, which is what the tutorial teaches.  We ran into some bugs because we would get confused with substituting variable and class names so we had to be careful with reading the actual code of the tutorial and understanding it rather than just copy-pasting.  

* Debugging in XCode was kind of a pain, the error messages weren't as helpful as they could have been in our opinion. 

* Originally we wanted to create category groupings so that it would separate the tableviewcell into themes (i.e. shoes, jackets, shirts, etc.) but after tinkering around, we ran into too many navigation issues and SIGABRTS.
